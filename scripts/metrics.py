# metrics.py -- the quantitative process-metrics ledger (CMMI-L4).
#
# Writes docs/METRICS.md from the tracker + CI, queried mechanically via `gh`
# (never hand-typed). Run at each compaction checkpoint (prepare_compaction
# refreshes it). This is NOT a CI gate -- it needs gh auth + network, and a
# metric is a thermometer, not a merge condition. It FAILS SOFT: if gh is
# unreachable or a query returns nothing, the affected metric reads `n/a`
# rather than crashing the checkpoint.
#
# Five metrics, each chosen because crossing its threshold changes a decision
# (not vanity counters). The thresholds are STARTING baselines -- a process
# can't be statistically controlled until it has data (~20+ points), so treat
# them as provisional until the window fills, then calibrate per project.
#
# Usage:
#   python scripts/metrics.py                 # write docs/METRICS.md (default 90-day window)
#   python scripts/metrics.py --window-days 30
#   python scripts/metrics.py --print         # print to stdout, do not write the file
#
# Single-implementation Python (like the audits/hooks) -- runs on both shells;
# no .ps1 twin. Stdlib only. cwd-independent.

# METRICS.md -- quantitative process ledger (CMMI-L4)

**Window:** last {WINDOW} days (since {cutoff.isoformat()}) · **Generated:** {today.isoformat()}{(' · ' + short_sha) if short_sha else ''} · **Source:** `gh` (tracker + CI), via `scripts/metrics.py`
{"" if gh_alive else chr(10) + "> :warning: `gh` was unreachable when this ran -- metrics below may be `n/a`. Re-run with a working `gh auth status`." + chr(10)}
The few metrics that each change a decision when they cross a threshold -- not a dashboard. Thresholds are **starting baselines**; a process isn't statistically controllable until the window holds ~20+ data points, so calibrate them per project once there's signal. A :warning: marks a metric past its alarm threshold -- route it to a [`retrospective`](../.claude/skills/retrospective/SKILL.md) (root-cause + leave a guard), don't just note it.

| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
|---|---|---|---|
