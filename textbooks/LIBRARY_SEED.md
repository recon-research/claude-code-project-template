# LIBRARY_SEED.md — Build A RAG-Ready Knowledge Library For Any Domain

> **You are Claude Code. A user dropped this file into an empty (or new) project folder and told you to read it and build a library for some subject.** This document is your complete instruction set. Follow it to produce a structured, self-validating, agent-ready knowledge library — the same architecture as a well-built engineering textbook series, but for *their* domain (a simulation engine, a trading system, a bioinformatics pipeline, a compiler, a robotics stack — anything).
>
> **How the user invokes you:** they say something like *"Read LIBRARY_SEED.md and let's build a library for &lt;X&gt;."* When you see that, **start at Step 1 (Interview)** below. Do not skip the interview — the whole point is a library shaped to *their* domain, not a generic dump.

This seed is domain-agnostic. Wherever it says "the subject" or "&lt;example-system&gt;", substitute the user's actual domain and their named example system.

---

## 0. What You're Building (the end state)

A finished library is a folder containing:

```
README.md  CLAUDE.md  AGENT_GUIDE.md  LIBRARY_SEED.md  CHANGELOG.md   — entry points & meta (root)
MANIFEST.json  SECTIONS.json  ROUTING_EVAL.json                        — machine indexes for RAG (root)
books/NN_title.md         — the curriculum, numbered, grouped into volumes
reference/                — lookup docs: GLOSSARY INDEX PATTERNS ANTI_PATTERNS DECISION_TREES
                            SYMPTOMS WORKFLOWS STARTER_KIT COMPARISON TOOLING (+ domain docs, see §6)
vision/                   — inspirational docs: PROLOGUE FUTURES MOONSHOTS (optional)
skills/                   — drop-in Claude Code skills + PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md
tools/                    — _gen_sections.py _audit_refs.py _audit_routing.py _audit_links.py (embedded §9; run from root)
```

The library serves two audiences: a **human** reading a study path, and an **LLM agent** consulting it via RAG while building real things in the domain. Everything below exists to make both work — and to keep the library **internally consistent and self-validating** as it grows.

The three properties that make it good:
1. **Routable** — an agent can get from a question to the right section fast (MANIFEST + SECTIONS).
2. **Verifiable** — every cross-reference resolves; routing is tested; nothing is asserted that can't be checked (the three `_audit_*` / `_gen_*` scripts enforce this).
3. **Honest** — it states what it does *not* cover (`coverage_gaps`) and where an agent's leverage is low.

---

## 1. Step 1 — Interview The User

Before writing anything, establish the shape of the library. Ask the user (batch these; don't interrogate one at a time):

1. **Subject & scope.** What is the library about? What's in scope and explicitly out of scope?
2. **Audience & assumed background.** Who reads it? What can you assume they already know?
3. **The named example system.** Pick (or ask for) a memorable name for the canonical example the library builds throughout — the analogue of a reference implementation. (e.g., a sim library might call its example simulator "Flux".) A consistent named example makes the library cohere; it also becomes the default in `PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md`.
4. **Tech / tool assumptions.** Default language(s), key libraries, formats, platforms — the "unless you say otherwise, we assume…" baseline.
5. **Major areas → the volume/book outline.** What are the big topic clusters? These become **volumes**; each splits into **books**. Get the user's mental model of the territory.
6. **Depth / scale & appetite.** How deep? A coherent **core of ~8–15 books** is a strong start; it can grow later via the deep-dive convention (§5). Don't over-commit to 40 books on day one unless they want that.
7. **Domain "realities."** Any non-technical concerns that matter (regulation, cost, team, ethics, ops)? These may warrant their own reference doc.

Then **propose a volume/book outline and the reference-doc set, and get explicit approval** before building. Show it as a numbered list grouped by volume. Iterate until they're happy. This outline drives everything else.

---

## 2. Step 2 — Conventions & Quality Bars (read before writing)

These conventions are what the validation scripts depend on. Adopt them exactly.

### 2.1 Section-ID grammar (critical — the scripts parse this)
Headings in books use these forms, and **citations reference them as `Book NN §X`**:
- `## N. Title` → section `N` (e.g. `## 4. Title` → §4)
- `### N.M Title` → subsection `N.M` (e.g. `### 4.3 Title` → §4.3); `#### N.M.K` for deeper.
- **Deep-dive sections** (to add depth without renumbering): `## N{Letter}. Title` and `### N{Letter}.M Title` — e.g. `## 4B. Deep Dive` → §4B, `### 4B.1` → §4B.1. **Use this to expand a book later** (a new §3B after §3) so existing §-citations never shift.
- **Section-letter books** (for big catalog-style books): `## Section A: Title` with `### A1. …`, `### A2. …`; cite as §A, §A1. (References may dot them: `§B.7` == heading `B7`.) For other catalog heading styles (`## Moonshot N`, `## Lesson N`, `## Case N`), add the lead word to the parser's word-set in `_gen_sections.py` / `_audit_refs.py` so `§N` resolves.
- Keep one `# Book NN — Title` H1 at the top of each book.

### 2.2 The book template (every book follows it)
A consistent skeleton makes books navigable and comparable:
1. **TL;DR** — one paragraph: what this book covers and the opinionated default it lands on.
2. **Conceptual foundations** — the *why* and context.
3. **Architecture & design** — system-level *how*, with comparisons to alternative approaches in the domain.
4. **Implementation** — concrete patterns / pseudo-code (illustrative, not necessarily compileable — say so).
5. **Bleeding edge** — recent research / state of the art.
6. **Gaps & opportunities** — where the field falls short.
7. **AI & Claude Code integration** — how an agent helps with *this* topic, and where it doesn't.
8. **Exercises & further reading.**
(Adapt headings to the domain, but keep the arc: concept → architecture → implementation → frontier → agent-integration.)

### 2.3 Citation discipline (the #1 rule)
**Never assert a `Book NN §X` citation you haven't verified exists.** After SECTIONS.json is generated, `grep` it (don't load it whole — it's large) to confirm a section before citing it. `_audit_refs.py` enforces this across the whole library; target is **0 unresolved references**. This is the single most important quality property — broken citations destroy agent trust.

### 2.4 Coverage honesty
Maintain `coverage_gaps` in MANIFEST: topics the library does **not** cover or covers only partially, each with `status` (`missing`/`partial`/`covered`), the nearest in-library section, and an external source. When an agent (or you) is asked about something thin, say so and point outward — do not fabricate coverage.

### 2.5 Leverage honesty
In CLAUDE.md and AGENT_GUIDE.md, state plainly where an agent's help is high vs low for this domain (boilerplate/refactor/tests ≈ high; novel architecture, judgment calls, debugging subtle interactions ≈ ~1×). An honest library sets correct expectations.

### 2.6 Validate after every structural change
Any time you add/rename/restructure: regenerate SECTIONS, run both audits, and grep for count drift. The scripts are fast; run them often. **Counts drift constantly** (book counts, skill counts, volume counts across README/CLAUDE/MANIFEST/memory) — treat a count as a thing to verify, not trust.

---

## 3. Step 3 — Build Order

Produce the library in this order (each step sets up the next):

1. **Scaffold `MANIFEST.json`** from the approved outline: `total_books`, `total_volumes`, `volumes[]`, and a `books[]` entry per book (`id` `book_NN`, `number`, `title`, `path`, `volume`, `topics[]`, `key_concepts[]`, `summary`). Leave `reference_docs`, `skills`, `topic_to_books`, `rag_hints`, `coverage_gaps` to fill as you go. (Schema in §6.1.)
2. **Create `tools/` and add the four scripts** (`_gen_sections.py`, `_audit_refs.py`, `_audit_routing.py`, `_audit_links.py` — verbatim from §9; run them from the repo root).
3. **Write the books** following §2.1–2.2. Cross-reference other books by `Book NN §X` — but only cite sections you've actually written (or fix citations at the end).
4. **Write the reference docs** appropriate to the domain (§6.2).
5. **Write the skills** — the 4 required universal meta-skills (+ the optional `adversarial_review`) + `PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md` (templates in §7), plus domain-specific execution skills derived from the library's atomic operations.
6. **Generate `SECTIONS.json`**: run `_gen_sections.py`.
7. **Write `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENT_GUIDE.md`, `README.md`** (templates in §6.3–6.4) using the now-real structure.
8. **Write `ROUTING_EVAL.json`**: ~30–60 realistic queries spanning every volume + reference doc, each with expected target(s) (§6.5).
9. **Validate to green**: run `_audit_refs.py` (0 misses) and `_audit_routing.py` (all pass). Fix what they flag — broken citations in the books; routing gaps by adding `topic_to_books`/`rag_hints` entries or enriching a book's `topics`/`summary`.
10. **Write `CHANGELOG.md`** (initial entry) and a final consistency sweep (counts, JSON validity, 0 leftover placeholder / example-system names).

---

## 4. The Maintenance Scripts Are The Backbone

Four small, domain-agnostic scripts keep the library honest. They live in `tools/`, are embedded verbatim in **§9**, and self-configure from MANIFEST, so they work for any domain. Write them early and run them from the repo root:

- **`_gen_sections.py`** → reads MANIFEST + the books, writes `SECTIONS.json` (every heading's id/title/line). Re-run after any heading edit.
- **`_audit_refs.py`** → validates every `Book NN §X` (and `DOC §X`) reference against the real headings. Target: **0 misses**. This is what makes "cite, don't assert" enforceable.
- **`_audit_routing.py`** → scores each `ROUTING_EVAL.json` query against the routing data and confirms the expected target ranks top-3. Catches routing **gaps** and **mis-routes** that the citation check can't see.
- **`_audit_links.py`** → validates every relative markdown link `[text](file.md)` resolves on disk. The citation checker does **not** check markdown links, so this is what keeps navigation (and any later file reorganization) safe. Target: **0 broken**.

A library that passes all four is internally consistent. Make passing them a release gate — they exit non-zero on failure, so CI can enforce that gate mechanically.

---

## 5. Growing The Library Later

- **Add a book** → append to `books/`, add a MANIFEST entry, update counts everywhere (README/CLAUDE/MANIFEST), add `topic_to_books`/`rag_hints` for its topics, regenerate SECTIONS, run both audits, add a ROUTING_EVAL case, log it.
- **Add depth to an existing book** → use the **deep-dive letter convention** (§2.1): a new `## 3B.` after `## 3.` adds material without renumbering, so no existing citation breaks.
- **Close a coverage gap** → write the content, flip the `coverage_gaps` entry to `covered`, and point any prose "we don't cover X" at the new section.
- **Rename the example system** → a scripted case-aware global replace across `*.md` + `MANIFEST.json`, then regenerate SECTIONS and run the audits (no section numbers change, so refs stay intact).

---

## 6. Artifact Specifications

### 6.1 MANIFEST.json (the machine index)
Top-level fields:
- `version`, `series_title`, `last_updated`, `total_books`, `total_volumes`, `engine_name` (rename to e.g. `system_name` for non-engine domains), `primary_assumptions` (object), `section_index` (`{"path":"SECTIONS.json","purpose":"…"}`).
- `volumes[]`: `{number, name, books:[NN,…]}` — contiguous book-number ranges.
- `books[]`: `{id:"book_NN", number, title, path, volume, topics[], key_concepts[], summary}`.
- `reference_docs[]`: `{id, path, topics[], summary}` (lowercase ids; the in-text references use the UPPERCASE form, e.g. `DECISION_TREES`).
- `skills[]`: `{path, triggers[], description}` per skill.
- `topic_to_books`: `{ "<topic_keyword>": ["book_NN", "DOC_NAME", …], … }` — reverse index from concept → target(s). **This is the primary routing surface; invest in it.**
- `rag_hints`: `{ "for_<question_type>": ["book_NN"/"DOC", …], … }` — intent → targets.
- `coverage_gaps`: `{description, gaps:[{topic, status, nearest, external}]}`.

Keep it valid JSON at all times (no trailing commas, no duplicate keys — a duplicate key silently wins-last). Validate after each edit.

### 6.2 Reference docs — which to include
**Universal (almost always):**
- `GLOSSARY.md` — alphabetized term definitions, each pinned to the book(s) that cover it.
- `INDEX.md` — back-of-book topical index (`Topic — NN §X`), alphabetical + thematic clusters at the end.
- `ANTI_PATTERNS.md` — failure modes (Symptom / Diagnosis / Fix / Books).
- `DECISION_TREES.md` — the domain's recurring architectural forks as flowcharts, with the trade-offs.
- `SYMPTOMS.md` — symptom→diagnosis lookup keyed on the user's vocabulary ("X is slow / wrong / flaky") → routes to ANTI_PATTERNS + sections.
- `PATTERNS.md` — named recurring techniques (shared vocabulary).
- `WORKFLOWS.md` — recipe-style multi-book task guides.
- `STARTER_KIT.md` — a milestone-driven path from zero to a shipped result, with exit criteria.

**Domain-flavored (include the analogues that fit):**
- `COMPARISON.md` — the example system vs the real alternatives/tools, feature-by-feature (was COMPARISON_MATRIX).
- `TOOLING.md` / `STACKS.md` — language/framework/tool choices with honest trade-offs (was TECH_STACKS).
- An **optimization/cookbook** doc if the domain has a deep perf/quality craft (was RENDERING_OPTIMIZATION).
- A **production/business/ops** doc for the non-technical realities (legal, cost, team, compliance) if relevant.
- Inspirational docs (a Prologue "why this matters", a Futures, a Moonshots) — optional but good for morale and framing.

### 6.3 CLAUDE.md (agent consult-rules) — include:
- What the library is + the two uses; a pointer to AGENT_GUIDE for *building*.
- A **task→doc routing table** (task type → first lookup), e.g. architectural decision → DECISION_TREES; "what does X mean" → GLOSSARY; "why is X broken" → SYMPTOMS; implementation → the relevant book; etc.
- How to use MANIFEST (`topic_to_books`/`rag_hints`/`coverage_gaps`) and SECTIONS (resolve/verify `§` refs — **grep it, don't load it whole**).
- Default assumptions (the §1.4 tech baseline).
- A "Topics Not Covered (be honest)" note deferring to `coverage_gaps` as the source of truth.
- Leverage honesty (where the agent is ~1×).
- Style notes (cite at the most specific level; acknowledge alternatives; don't dogmatically apply patterns).

### 6.4 AGENT_GUIDE.md (the build loop) — include:
- **Load order** of artifacts (MANIFEST resident; SECTIONS grep-on-demand; STARTER_KIT for order; DECISION_TREES for forks; then the specific sections; skills; ANTI_PATTERNS/SYMPTOMS).
- A **"Finding the library" contract**: the downstream project's own CLAUDE.md carries a one-line pointer to the library path; if the agent can't find MANIFEST.json, ask.
- **The build loop**: classify → route → pre-mortem (ANTI_PATTERNS/SYMPTOMS first) → decide (DECISION_TREES) → implement → atomize (skill) → verify → profile → record.
- A **worked example**: one concrete end-to-end trace through the loop for a small feature, each step citing a verifiable `Book NN §X`. (Worked examples anchor agents far better than abstract description — always include one.)
- A **definition-of-done** checklist (the verification gate).
- A **skills map** (atomic operation → skill).
- **Leverage honesty** table.
- **Maintenance**: regenerate SECTIONS + run both audits after edits.

### 6.5 ROUTING_EVAL.json — `{cases:[{query, expect:["book_NN"/"doc_id"], note?}]}`. Cover every volume and every reference doc with realistic, natural-language queries. Where more than one target is correct, list them all (pass = any in top-3).

---

## 7. Skills

Skills are drop-in Claude Code procedures (`.claude/skills/`). Each is a markdown file with **YAML frontmatter** (required — without it the skill will not load):
```
---
name: skill_name            # must match the filename
description: One sentence on what it does AND when to use it (the triggers). Claude reads this to decide when to invoke.
---
# Title
## Procedure   (numbered, actionable steps)
## Verification (how to confirm it worked)
## Don't       (the common mistakes)
```

**Create these universal meta-skills (near-verbatim — they're domain-independent; the fifth is optional):**
- **`plan_work`** — produce a *library-grounded plan* for a task: classify → route via MANIFEST/SECTIONS → ANTI_PATTERNS/SYMPTOMS pre-mortem → emit a plan (recommended approach with verifiable `Book NN §X` citations, alternatives + trade-offs, failure modes, steps each mapped to an execution skill, verification gates, leverage honesty, open decisions for the human). The planning front-end. *Don't*: invent citations; present one option as the only one; jump to code.
- **`review_against_library`** — *conformance audit* of an existing design/diff against the library (recommended approaches, cataloged anti-patterns, conventions), with cited findings grouped **Must-fix vs Consider**. Supports a `--fix` mode that applies only the mechanical Must-fix items (on a branch, re-verified), deferring redesigns to `plan_work`. *Don't*: dogmatically flag defensible divergence; hunt generic bugs (that's `/code-review`); invent citations.
- **`configure_project`** — inspect the repo and fill `PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md` (the per-project paths/commands/stack the other skills read), so nothing is hard-coded per skill.
- **`definition_of_done`** — run the full verification gate (build/tests/the domain's checks/anti-patterns/etc.) with per-gate PASS/FAIL + evidence; refuse "done" with an unrun or failing gate. Orchestrates the other verification skills.
- **`adversarial_review`** *(optional but recommended)* — an end-of-feature *adversarial* review: fan out one independent reviewer per **failure-domain lens** for the domain (for an engine: performance/determinism, memory/data-layout, concurrency, library-conformance, headless/agent-playability; for a compiler: IR-invariants, perf, diagnostics, spec-conformance — pick the domain's real failure axes), each prompted to *find what's wrong*, then reconcile into cited Must-fix/Consider findings. **Delegate the fan-out** to the harness (`/code-review ultra`, the Workflow tool, or parallel subagents) — don't hand-roll orchestration. It *composes* `review_against_library` (the conformance lens) and `/code-review` (the generic-bug lens); it's the review pass before `definition_of_done`. *Don't*: reinvent agent spawning; make the lenses redundant; invent citations.

**Plus `PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md`** (a config file, NOT a skill — keep it at project root): the example-system name, language, source layout, build/test/run commands, stack, conventions, and agent tooling — with the library's defaults filled in and a note to override per project. This is the **de-hardcoding mechanism**: skills read project specifics from here instead of baking them in.

**Optionally `PROJECT_BACKLOG.md`** (also project-root, also NOT a skill): a lightweight Now/Next/Blocked/Done convention keyed to the STARTER_KIT milestones that `plan_work` appends to and `definition_of_done` checks off — cross-session continuity, *not* an issue tracker (defer to GitHub Issues / Linear / the harness task tools at scale).

**Then derive domain-specific execution skills** from the library's recurring atomic operations — the "add a &lt;thing&gt;", "test a &lt;thing&gt;", "profile/optimize a &lt;thing&gt;", "debug a &lt;thing&gt;" tasks that come up repeatedly in *this* domain. Each cites its backing book(s). (For an engine these were add_component / add_render_pass / profile_subsystem / debug_shader…; for a sim they might be add_entity_type / add_event / add_metric / validate_determinism; for a compiler, add_pass / add_diagnostic / add_ir_node. Pick the real recurring operations.)

Wire every skill into: the MANIFEST `skills[]` array, README + CLAUDE skill lists (and counts), `skills/README.md` table, and the AGENT_GUIDE skills map. Keep the skill count consistent across all of them (it drifts — verify it).

---

## 8. Pitfalls (hard-won — heed them)

- **Counts drift.** Book/skill/volume/word counts get stale across README/CLAUDE/MANIFEST/memory the moment you add anything. After any structural change, grep for the old count and fix every site. Trust the scripts, not your memory of the number.
- **Citations rot.** A `Book NN §X` that was right becomes wrong when sections move, or was a *line number* mistaken for a section, or names a real section on the wrong topic. The mechanical audit catches the first two; only reading catches the third. Run `_audit_refs.py` after every edit; spot-read citations for topic-match.
- **Routing is invisible until tested.** A missing `topic_to_books` entry silently sends agents nowhere; a mis-pointed `rag_hint` sends them to the wrong book. `_audit_refs` won't catch it — only `_audit_routing` will. Maintain ROUTING_EVAL.
- **Skills need frontmatter.** A skill file without valid `name`/`description` YAML frontmatter silently fails to load. Validate all skills parse.
- **Don't renumber to add depth.** Use the deep-dive letter convention; renumbering breaks every inbound citation.
- **Don't hard-code the example name or paths into skills.** Route them through PROJECT_CONVENTIONS — otherwise every downstream agent reads specifics that aren't its project's.
- **Big JSON indexes are query targets, not load targets.** Tell agents to grep SECTIONS.json, not load it (it's hundreds of KB).
- **Be honest about gaps and leverage.** A library that overclaims coverage or agent-leverage erodes trust faster than one that's modest and correct.

## 9. The Maintenance Scripts (write these verbatim)

These are domain-agnostic — they self-configure from MANIFEST. Write them to `tools/` and run from the repo root (with UTF-8 output, e.g. `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 PYTHONUTF8=1 python tools/_audit_refs.py`). The `_audit_refs.py` / `_audit_links.py` scans glob `reference/` and `vision/` as well — adjust the globbed dirs if your layout differs.

### 9.1 `_gen_sections.py`
```python
import re, json, os

## 10. Final Checklist (don't declare done until all true)

- [ ] The outline was approved by the user before building.
- [ ] Every book follows the template and the section-ID grammar.
- [ ] `MANIFEST.json` is valid JSON; counts (`total_books`, `total_volumes`) match reality; `coverage_gaps` is honest.
- [ ] `SECTIONS.json` regenerated; `_audit_refs.py` reports **0 misses**.
- [ ] `ROUTING_EVAL.json` covers every volume + reference doc; `_audit_routing.py` reports **all pass**.
- [ ] All skills have valid frontmatter; the 4 required meta-skills (+ optional `adversarial_review`) + `PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md` exist; the skill count is consistent across MANIFEST/README/CLAUDE/skills-README.
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` (routing table + honesty) and `AGENT_GUIDE.md` (build loop + worked example + maintenance) exist and reflect the real structure.
- [ ] No leftover placeholder names; the example-system name is consistent everywhere; `PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md` carries it as the default.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` has an initial entry; `README.md` has reading paths + stats.
- [ ] A grep for the old/placeholder counts returns nothing.

*This seed encodes a simple thesis: a knowledge library is most useful to an agent when it is **routable, verifiable, and honest** — and stays that way because small scripts make consistency a gate, not a hope. Build the library; then let the scripts keep it true.*
